# cyber-identity
For the hacktoberfest event based in Saint-Gaudens.

A serious game about hacking culture &amp; datas to raise public awareness about what information people can access on the internet. I will try to update this repo as much as possible for more informations.

## The game

You lost your memory, all you've got is a strange message from an uknown number, attached to the message there is a picture.
Based on the photo you've got, retrive your identity.

## Dev
For now it's just a prototype but the goal is a develop a chatbot. 

## Theme
Hacking, cybersecurity, big data, IA.
